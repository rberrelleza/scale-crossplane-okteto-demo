# Using Kubernetes and Crossplane Together to Help Developers Code Cloud Native Applications

All developers building cloud-native applications can benefit from being able to replicate the complex production environment during development. This talk would benefit the ecosystem by showing how Kubernetes based development environments combined with Crossplane have the ability to empower developers to do exactly this.

Attendees will learn about Kubernetes based development environments and how they make developing cloud-native applications much more simple than traditional ways of development. They will also walk away with a better understanding of how Crossplane works and why it is an effective tool for developers to provision all the production infrastructure during development.

This talk aims to solve the problem most developers face these days - not being able to easily replicate their production setup during development. The talk will benefit all cloud-native application developers by showing them how to set up a development workflow using Crossplane, which allows provisioning all the production infrastructure very conveniently during development, and Kubernetes based Remote Development Environments.
